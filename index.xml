      <description>I earned a Ph.D. in AI Planning and Robotics from IEETA at the University of Aveiro, Portugal. My doctoral dissertation contributes to the development of novel algorithms for knowledge representation, robot learning, and task planning. Prior to this, I earned my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in computer engineering from Qazvin Azad University in Iran.&#xA;Following the completion of my Ph.D., I conducted postdoctoral research in the Robotics Research Group at KU Leuven from December 2018 to August 2022.</description>

      <description>Research Line Link to heading Automated planning has been a foundational research area within AI since the field’s inception, with researchers continually making significant contributions over decades. Planning is a decision-making technology that involves reasoning based on a predictive model of a system and deciding how and when to act in order to achieve a desired objective. It is a relevant technology for many application areas that need quick, automated and optimal decisions, such as agile manufacturing, agrifood, and logistics.</description>
